  <h2>Muskingum method</h2>
  The Muskingum routing procedure is used for systems that have <strong><u>Storage-Discharge</u> relationships</strong> that are hysteretic. That is, for systems for which the outflow is not a unique function of storage. The S vs. O relationship for the river reach under consideration is graphed below.
  <h3>A. Parameter Estimation</h3>
  Use these observations to obtain the Muskingum routing parameters k and x for this river reach. The initial storage in the system is 715,000 m3.<br>

  <br><br>Graphical Procedure:<br><br>
  The graphical procedure consists in <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~ramirez/ce_old/classes/cive322-Ramirez/CE322_Web/Example_MuskingumRouting.htm" target="_blank" title="Example_MuskingumRouting">generating graphs</a> of [xI + (1-x)O] vs. S for different values of x, arbitrarily selected such that 0 < x < 0.5. The optimal value of x is selected as that which produces the narrowest and straightest loop graph of [xI + (1-x)O] vs. S. The slope of the least squares linear fit to the resulting points is the estimate of k.<p style="margin-top:45px">a) Generate accumulated storage in the system.
